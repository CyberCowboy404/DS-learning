When I purchased it, it had 6872 miles and now it has 7,783. It's been garage kept and has never been down. It starts every time and on the first attempt, and it runs like a beast. If you know, you know. This is one of the best sounding motorcycles you can own. Hearing the engine rev makes the hair on neck stand up. I never entered the bike in any shows, but the previous owner did and won a couple of first place awards in the Best of Modern Italian Motorcycle category (Included). The bike is currently registered in CA for 2023. The buyer will receive both Black Keys and the infamous RED KEY along with the KEY CODE CARD which contains the electronic code and the mechanical code for the motorcycle. I think the red key is about $500 to replace so don't lose it. The bike has upgraded exhaust pipes and fold down mirrors. It also has front light screen protector and solo single seat conversion with rear cowl which adds a clean smooth aerodynamic racing profile to the look. The racing number 7 reflects the year the model year of 2007. Please see the attached invoice the last service I did at my Ducati dealer. The total invoice as $2,152.14. I had brought the bike in because it wasn't turning over. Apparently it had been sitting for too long and the gas had gone bad. The invoice provides a detailed account of everything that was done. It's in excellent condition from top to bottom. Tires were replaced about two years ago and are in excellent condition as well. The bike is located in Beverly Hills CA. These GT100 models were only produced between 2007 and 2010 and are highly sought after which means youre almost certain to recoup your purchase price should you ever choose to sell this highly collectable bike.Heres a link if youd like to read more about this model. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_SportClassic The reason Im selling is that I just have too many bikes and not enough time to ride them.

A dynamic, fluid and technological design, LED headlights and state-of-the-art full-TFT colour instrumentation make for breath-taking appeal and attention to detail.Dynamic, sophisticated, technologically advanced, unique; in two words: Italian StyleFlowing lines and essential surfaces create a volume difference between the front and rear: the final result is a dynamic, sporty design. The striking front view with a colour-matched ""beak"", embellished by the signature Ducati logo, is characterised by an aggressive, high-tech headlight which, together with the compact rear light with light-guide effect, are iconic features of the Multistrada. The muscular front is in contrast with the streamlined tail, enhanced by the low-slung exhaust: made of top quality die-cast aluminium, it is left in full view to integrate the side luggage supports.Ducati Testastretta DVTThe Multistrada 1200 is powered by the brand-new revolutionary Ducati Testastretta DV",DUC,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.7522258758544922}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.821104109287262}]"

Brand New brake job front and rear!  Upgraded levers.  I have all receipts for maintenance, all done by the dealer.  I love this bike and you will too.  I'm only selling it because I need a car for work.",DUC,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.5709255337715149}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9508540034294128}]"

For 2021 Ducati presents the Streetfighter V4 S in a new Dark Stealth color scheme, which joins the sporty Ducati Red.The Panigale V4 stripped of its fairings and with high-and-wide handlebar. This is the design concept behind the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that can amplify the emotions of its rider and make them feel like the leader of the pack on every outing on the road. The result is an unrivalled, contemporary, technology-packed naked bike, with a powerful and exciting design that does nothing to hide its performance.Fast, agile mixed-road performance demands maximum stability at high speed and when braking, reduced wheel-up during acceleration and minimized electronic control of the suspension set-up: that's why Ducati Corse specialists have, together with the Ducati Style Centre, developed biplane wings for the Streetfighter V4.The aerodynamics were developed using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation. The calculation method involved stationary simulation of flow and pressure to achieve increased downforce, especially on the front wheel.",DUC,"[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.31017330288887024}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7854154706001282}]"

ADULT OWNED, NO ACCIDENTS OR DROPS. Beautiful bike with a fantastic riding position and crazy torque. Serious eye turner. Let me know any questions you have!2015 Ducati Diavel Carbon Star White and Matt Carbon ""Don't call me a cruiser"" The Diavel Carbon exemplifies the distinctive style and sporty soul of the Diavel with high-quality, light-weight components. Clad with carbon fiber and Marchesini forged wheels, weight is reduced to just 205 kg, only further enhancing the performance of this extraordinary motorcycle.The intoxicating design, with innovative LED headlight, and refined rider comfort of the new Diavel may imply ""cruiser,"" but the brute force of its 162 hp Testastretta engine and its razor sharp handling prove otherwise.Power and Torque With its 162hp and colossal 96lb-ft of torque, the Diavel Testastretta 11° DS engine defines authentic Ducati Desmodromic performance. Thanks to dual spark plugs, high-compression pistons, and revised injection spray targeting, the engine's torque curve is strong and smooth at low rpm, and remains so through a wide rev-range. The engine output is managed by Ducati's Ride-by-Wire (RbW) system to ensure effortless ridability, with plenty of power on tap also for high-rpm riding. Twin lateral radiators To keep the frontal lines of the Diavel clean, the technical solution of a highly efficient lateral radiator is placed on each side of the bike. These well-ducted units, located beneath the fuel tank, use aerodynamics to help draw cooling air flow through them and are assisted by high-flow electric fans when required. Their shape integrates seamlessly with the overall design, combining form and function to enhance the muscular presence of the bike.Ergonomics The redesigned, more comfortable seat offers more room and has a low height of 770 mm, which allows for extended hours of riding pleasure and makes the Diavel accessible to a wide range of riders. A relaxed handlebar position sits naturally in the rider's reach, ensuring full control and comfort with the unmatched coolness of cruiser style. Marzocchi forks with low-friction fork legs The Diavel uses 50 mm Marzocchi front forks with fork legs finished in low-friction diamond-like carbon (DLC). These forks are fully adjustable for spring pre-load and compression.",DUC,"[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.46616441011428833}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9251202344894409}]"

Start off with the road-holding prowess of huge 50 millimeter Marzocchi forks, gripped by a triple screw lower fork crown. These cartridge damper forks work as impressively as they look, with special high rigidity stainless steel sliders and external adjustability for compression and rebound damping, plus spring pre-load. The rear suspension performs with equal precision by using a fully adjustable ZF Sachs shock mounted to a robust single-sided swingarm.Light Marchesini wheels mounted on large diameter axles are fitted with the latest Z-rated Bridgestone BT014 tires sporting a fat 180/55 section on the rear. Stopping power is controlled by twin radially mounted Brembo four piston calipers gripping new lightweight 305 millimeter twin discs up front, and a 245 millimeter disc at the rear to make stopping as thrilling as gassing it.The new 1100 Desmo engine pumps out potent torque and horsepower. Twist the throttle and no matter the rpm, fuel injected power is at the riders command. The lightweight, 90 degree twin stands at the pinnacle of more than three decades of Desmo air-cooled development. One ride makes it clear why the 1100 engine has charmed journalists worldwide.

This is one of three produced by Mark Henry and C&J Racing Frames in 1987. The inspiration was the new, at that time, Ducati F-1 which offered state of the art styling and handling but an engine that was considerably cheapened when compared to the labor intensive, traditional, old world craftsmanship of the bevel drive desmo engines like the one that took Mike Hailwood to victory at the Isle of Man TT races a few years earlier.The C&J frame is carefully designed and constructed of high quality, light weight, 4130 chrome moly tubing. C&J achieved a very strong and light structure. The frame also has some nice features. The steering head angle is steeper and adjustable in a 2* range to get the feel that you like. The rear suspension is a mono-shock design that reduces the wheelbase considerably to 58 inches for fast steering.The fiberglass tank, tail section, fender, and fairing are the highest quality products you will ever see. Mark Henry had these carefully made at Fiber Systems, his company. The custom paint work in pearl white and green metallic with black striping is stunning.Suspension on this bike is upgraded to the highest spec adjustable Marzocchi M1R front forks and Works Performance aluminum remote reservoir mono-shock.Braking is handled by top of the line Brembo gold components up front featuring twin floating discs and 4 piston race spec calipers. Rear braking also features quality Brembo parts.Real Marvic magnesium wheels are mounted, front and rear. Very light weight!Other features are custom billet aluminum triple clamps with the lower clamp acting as a brake line junction, genuine Ducati gauges and switchgear, Ducati F-1 foot controls, and custom Bub exhaust.Engine number 086784 has around 50 miles on it since a complete rebuild by Dr. Desmo of Evanston IL. The displacement is 905cc(88mmx74.4mm) and I have 8, hand written pages of assembly notes with dimensions that are included. Features noted are 42mm and 38mm mille valves, aluminum clutch kit, stainless screw set, gear gazer, heavy breather, aluminum oil filter cover, aluminum tower tubes, and lightened clutch assembly.In June of 1987 Motorcyclist magazine did a feature article on the personal C&J Ducati of creator Mark Henry. The 4 page article by Nick Ienatsch was very complimentary. Its an easy bike to ride briskly; the legendary Ducati power pushing a substantially lighter bike... This theme is echoed in the fairing and tank, in the big 900 mill enclosed in a maze of chrome-moly tubing, in the bikes cornering performance and even in its braking abilities. Its a sound principle. Nick raved about the handlin",DUC,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.504757821559906}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5133728384971619}]"

At 369 pounds (168 kilograms) the 848 is an amazing 44 pounds (20 kilograms) lighter than its predecessor, and a significant 11 pounds (5 kilograms) lighter than its larger capacity brother, the 1098.The highly advanced 848 engine uses an improved method of engine case production in which cases are vacuum die-cast formed. While providing significant weight savings of more than 6.5 pounds (3 kilograms), this method also ensures consistent wall thickness and increased strength. Further refinements include a sophisticated wet clutch that offers 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) less weight, a much higher service life, improved clutch feel and quiet operation.With the first twist of the wrist, the powerful rush of the Testastretta Evoluzione engine confirms that the rules have changed. The 848's 134 horsepower is not only 30 percent more powerful than its predecessor, but it provides a power-to-weight ratio even better than the potent 999.The 848 - a new class of Superbikes.",DUC,"[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.48774242401123047}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8777979016304016}]"

"5,796 miles","$10,999 ",SMC 690 R,  2019 KTM Super Moto,"I purchased this 2019 KTM SMCR 690 last year with 5700 miles on it. I have only put 100 miles on the bike and, unfortunately, am forced to sell the bike due to an impending neck surgery that will not allow me to ride motorcycles for a while. I have ridden Kawasaki, Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha, Ducati, and KTM bikes and have never ridden anything this enthusiastic. At only 306 lbs dry, this thing is so flickable and truly is a wheelie monster. The front wheel lifts easily with the flick of your wrist. If thats your thing, the SMCR 690 will not disappoint.The previous owner had a gentle lay down in a parking and left a little bit of rash on the right handguard, clutch, front fork knuckle, and ever so slight rash on the swingarm. He also stripped the graphics and painted the bike black. The very minor damage does not affect how the bike rides at all. I have had it inspected by KTM to ensure that it was safe to ride and have had most of the rash fixed.While the black did look menacing, it needed a little something else so I spruced it up with a brand new graphics kit. The swingarm hardly had any rash, which I covered up with some swingarm sliders. The handguards were replaced with OEM KTM handguards. Rather than purchasing a new clutch cover due to the rash on the bottom, I purchased a KTM power parts carbon fiber clutch cover so it does need a new clutch cover if you want to take the carbon fiber cover off (but why would you do that?) Finally, the most rash is on the front fork knuckle which, unfortunately, cannot be replaced without replacing the entire fork. Now that the bad is out of the way, lets get to the good (or great). I have added a number of upgrades making this, in my humble opinion, one of the best looking KTM SMC R 690s out there. Heres a list of all of the upgrades:In preparation for the sale, I have performed the following maintenance:CLEAN TITLE.

485 miles,"$9,500 ",350 EXC-F,  2018 KTM Dual Sport,"KTM 350 EXC-F is based largely on the 2016 SX models, but featuring lighter, more compact engines that improve power delivery. While described as a dual sport, these bikes are essentially racing dirt bikes with turn signals and a provision for a license plate. I am the original owner and bike is barely ridden with under 500 miles on the odometer.The 350-cc four-stroke fuel-injected single-cylinder engine knocked almost 4.5 pounds off of the engine of the SX series bikes. The manufacturer describes as the most perfectly balanced powerplant. These bikes feature a Keihin Engine Management System with a 42-mm throttle body and separate circuits for cold start and idle adjustments. The engine starts easily on the electric start, and runs perfectly. The bike has a six-speed manual gearbox sourced from PANKL Racing Systems, which allows the bike to have the highest durability and reliability level. No leaks from the engine or the gearbox.Bodywork consists of a headlight bucket, front and rear fenders, and side panels, all molded in orange and black plastic with vinyl KTM graphics. The bike shows no signs of damage to the bodywork, on the fender edges, or the sides. The body covers a 2.245-gallon fuel tank made of translucent plastic for easy fuel level visibility. The only modification the seller points out is the addition of plastic handguards that are mounted to a cast-aluminum frame. The seat is a black, grippy vinyl, which allows significant range of motion when seated or standing on the pegs. The upholstery has no damage, the handgrips is in good condition, and the ends of the brake and clutch levers have no damage from falls. Both the brake pedal and the shifter lever, and the bear-trap footpegs, are in good shape. The only gauge is a small digital meter with a speedometer readout and odometer showing 485 miles. The EXC-F chassis is lightweight chromoly steel, while the rear subframe is aluminum and weighs just 900 grams. The 260-mm front and 220-mm rear disc brakes, and the black aluminum spoked wheels, are reported to be from the factory. The wheels are equipped with new racing tires as new, and the original never   are also available. DOCUMENTATION - Directly owned, will be sold on a clean New York title . Four-stroke dual sport motorcycles like this 2017 KTM 350 EXC-F provide the light weight and agility of a dirt bike, with the required equipment for legal registration in all 50 states.

For the first time, it offers Bosch's new MSC (Motorcycle Stability Control). MSC enhances the existing package consisting of lean-sensitive traction control and ABS featuring a combined braking function with a world first: the first ever lean-sensitive cornering ABS. As ever, it sets standards in the travel segment: 150 hp with a weight of only 230 kg fully tanked combine to produce a power-to-weight ratio previously unheard of in this class and therefore delivering unrivalled ride dynamics. At the same time, the powerful, economical and cultivated engine enables either particularly relaxed and comfortable riding or, if required, super-sporty propulsion with every conceivable level in between. The chassis combines lightness with outstanding geometry and fantastic suspension, which, together with completely new tires for the travel enduro class, allow undreamed of riding pleasure in all conditions and whatever speed you desire.Although substantially more powerful and equipped more comprehensively, the 1190 Adventure consumes about 20 per cent less fuel than its predecessor with an impressive 23-litre tank capacity.A unique mix of the highest quality components combined with a fully developed and reliable engine allows extremely long service intervals of 15,000 kmThe guarantee for smooth throttle response, not just no throttle control cable: The 1190 Adventure's ride-by-wire system ensures perfect application of the readily available and plentiful torque. It also electronically translates the throttle commands of the rider into throttle valve positions perfectly suited to the riding conditions. The DBW system is fully compliant with the s",KTM,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.6090869307518005}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7251625657081604}]"

I'm the second owner and have had the bike since 2018. It's never let me down, has consistently started right up after any storage period, and is always up for whatever terrain I point it at. It's got a few scratches and dings here and there but I've never mistreated it, never neglected regular maintenance and have always treated it with TLC. Below is a list of all the modifications and their MSRP price, an added value of over $6,000. Most notable of the changes would be the rally fairing with crazy bright head lights, the Rottweiler intake system and Powercommander combo bringing the total horsepower of the bike to just under 80hp, and the heavier weight fork and shock springs to accommodate my weight (200lbs) and added gear while touring.

105 miles,"$11,000 ",790 DUKE,  2020 KTM Sportbike,"Thank you for stopping by and checking out my beautiful brand new 790 Duke. I bought this bike when i had a lot of time on my hands but the next week after purchasing the bike i got a new job that takes up all my time. Now the bike sits in my garage taking up space. The bike has 105 miles!!!! yes it hasn't been broken into yet, its the only 790 on the market to have 105 miles. I removed all the stock decals to give it the all black sleek look but if you like decals its ready for a new decal sticker kit. I also up graded the handle bars to pro taper evo bars for better comfort but if you dont like them i also have the stock handle bars. As you can see this bike has an upgraded tail tidy, the stock one sticks out way too far and i think everyone can agree this tail tidy is way sleeker. Also upgraded the handle bar grips and i have 2 brand new handle bar mirrors and i have a brand new 2 finger clutch lever that i have not installed yet cause i have been swamped with work. When i purchased the bike at the dealership they already installed these ugly crash bars on it so i just left them on for protection until i got a crash cage but never came down to it. The specs on this bike are crazy it has 4 different ride modes Street, Track, Sport and rain its also has launch control & one of the best specs would be the quick shifter and your able to turn it off and on with a press of a button theirs so many other specs on this bike.

The bike has 222 miles on the odometer and a total of 11 hours riding time. The bike has never been in any accidents. It hasnt even fallen over. I would rate the condition of the bike as mint or near-showroom condition. Ive been the only rider on the bike and most of my riding was done in open fields and gravel roads. The bike has seen very little highway use and its never been raced. The bike needs a quick wash to remove some mild dust and dirt. Its currently registered in the state of Virginia but needs a current Virginia safety inspection. Im certain it will pass a safety inspection and can make the sale contingent on a current inspection if that is a concern. The bike has had the 600-mile service. The service was performed by the KTM dealer MotoMember in Purcellville, VA. The bike has been lightly ridden and well-maintained.Specifications:ENGINE: BORE (MM) 88COMPRESSION RATIO 12.3:1COOLING LiquidDISPLACEMENT IN CC 349.7DISPLACEMENT IN CI 21.3ENGINE TYPE Single-CylinderSTARTER ElectricSTROKE 57.5VALVE CONFIGURATIONS SOHC TRANSMISSION:NUMER OF SPEEDS 6TRANSMISSION TYPE Manual TIRES: FRONT TIRE Continental TKC 80 90/90 R21REAR TIRE Continental TKC 80 120/100 R18 BRAKES: FRONT BRAKE DIAMETER 260FRONT BRAKE TYPE Hydraulic DiscREAR BRAKE DIAMETER 8.7REAR BRAKE TYPE REAR Hydraulic DiscSUSPENSION & STEERING: AIR ADJUSTABLE NoFRONT SUSPENSION BRAND NAME WPFRONT SUSPENSION TYPE Inverted ForkREAR ADJUSTABLE REBOUND DAMPING YesREAR ADJUSTABLE SHOCK / SPRING PRE-LOAD YesREAR SUSPENSION BRAND NAME WPSUSPENSION TYPE Twin Sided Swing ArmSEAT HEIGHT (IN) 37.8OTHER:FUEL CAPACITY (GAL) 2.3MANUFACTURER COUNTRY AustriaMANUFACTURER TYPE EnduroDRY WEIGHT (LBS) 237WHEELBASE (IN) 58.3The bike comes with everything that I received when I purchased it including owners manual, tools, etc. Also includes extra tools and parts such as an extra KTM OEM seat; The 15mm lower seat installed; original seat included, Enduro Engineering Aluminum Rear Disc Brake Fin, Two skid plates--one KTM OEM and one aftermarket; New aftermarket Lithium-Ion battery installed and original KTM OEM battery that still holds a charge;",KTM,"[{'label': '3 stars', 'score': 0.2732764780521393}]","[{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6208817362785339}]"

Tech features include fly-by-wire throttle, adjustable suspension, advanced multi-setting ABS brakes, Traction Control that functions off-road, smooth reliable fuel injection and a fit & finish worthy of the price tag...all these drove many to claim a GS killer had finally arrived.

Rear shows some wear, but still plenty of life left All paint and plastic is very good - above average for an off-road trail bike. Brake pedal has a small crack in it, and is slightly bent, but doesn't affect operation. New Battery Note, the prior owner put a lot of stickers on it. We think it's the OEM exhaust and not and FMF like the sticker says. Hour meter read 90.3 hours, and it definitely works, but we can't be 100% certain when the hour meter was installed.

"2,309 miles","$8,495 ",Duke 690,  2018 KTM Standard,"2018 KTM Duke 690 , Two decades ago, the original Duke was nothing short of revolutionary. KTM s first single-cylinder street bike grew into a cult classic, adding extreme fun to a raw and radical concept. Today s 690 DUKE stays faithful to its ancestor s ways, but adds future-proof refinements: impressive smoothness, sophisticated electronics, improved ergonomics and tons of grunt. This firmly cements the world s strongest single-cylinder production motorcycle at the cutting edge of engineering. Long live the Duke! The brilliant LC4 showcases twenty-four carats of fun. With its powerful, lightweight single combined with a sophisticated electronic engine management , dual-spark ignition with plug-selective mappings and a second balancer shaft, the results are top refinement, a wide powerband and a full 54 kW (73 hp) of peak power. Despite its pronounced lust for cornering, the 690 Duke also presents versatile real-world capabilities. On a daily basis, particularly the two-piece seat will prove a valuable friend. It s comfortable and spacious, while still being set up for all dynamic riding situations. The seating position and freedom of movement behind the wide aluminum handlebar provide perfect support for controlling the bike both in traffic hell as well as cornering heaven. Workday commute or weekend blast: the 690 Duke has your back. Check out the aftermarket exhaust for that added growl!!! This bike like all our bikes will be fully serviced, inspected and detailed at the time you take delivery.

"7,066 miles","$4,600 ",METEOR 350,Used 2022 Royal Enfield Classic / Vintage,"2022 Blue Royal Enfield Meteor Super Nova 350 , , A brand that you don't run across often enough. Royal Enfield started production in 1901 and is responsible for the Royal Enfield Bullet, which became the longest-lived motorcycle design ever. The company has changed quite a bit over the years but these folks know a thing or two about the basic two wheeled transportation device that we know and love as the motorcycle.The Meteor is equipped with a 349cc, fuel injected, air cooled single cylinder engine that develops almost all of it's torque at 1800 rpm, which is perfect for an in town commuter. Weighing in at just 421 pounds, the 350 is a light , easy to handle motorcycle. Don't let the Retro looks, heritage or styling deceive you though, this is a thoroughly modern machine. A 5 speed transmission with toe and heel shifting and chain final drive for efficiently and low maintenance. The engine from the factory will not allow this bike to exceed 75 mph which provides quite a few advantages. 1-you can't go crazy fast to kill yourself, 2-you should be able to prevent yourself from receiving a speeding ticket, and 3-there is absolutely zero chance of red-lining, so your engine will not self-destruct! Disc brakes front and rear bring you to a halt. The comfort of this seat, passenger as well, exceeds that of the Honda Rebel and you could easily ride it for hours and miles without discomfort. Technology includes ABS, a halogen headlight, a L.E.D. brake light, and a small screen located next to the analog speedometer functions as a GPS using the Royal Enfield App and a second clock. Throw in about 60 mpg and the Meteor 350 is worth checking out, especially this Super Nova model. Straightforward and retro, these are cool bikes.Exclusively used for commute to and from work, over 100 miles each way! Serviced 3 times and, mileage wise, most recently. New spare oil filters included. Garaged 100% when not being ridden. Comes with original 2 keys. One owner with cleared clean Nevada Title paperwork. Selling to help pay off credit cards in preparation for a replacement car for my wife!",RE,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.42863062024116516}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5476356744766235}]"

Engine and tires and brakes are all through the initial break-in phase allowing the bike to be ridden normally. Bike has never been dropped, has been stored in a warm garage it's whole life, and hasn't given me any issues. Still has all original equipment and is still fully stock.

I am selling it because I have multiple bikes and need to offload one. It is perfect for someone looking to get on the road. Beginner or expert, this bike has all of the comfort and performance youll want. The Royal Enfield Meteor 350 Supernova is a lot of fun. This bike handles great and inspires confidence in turning. The seating position is really comfortable and the power delivery in third and fourth gears are outstanding. This small-displacement cruiser is powered by a 349cc air/oil-cooled electronically-fuel-injected single-cylinder engine that produces very smooth, approachable power for easygoing cruising. The Meteors handling is impressive. The 41mm telescopic fork and twin downtube chassis remains incredibly steady through turns and that boosts confidence.Braking is done by ByBre, specifically, a two-piston floating caliper and single-piston floating caliper grip on the 300mm and 270mm discs (front and rear respectively).While its main competitors have full LED lighting systems, the Royal Enfield features a halogen headlight, with an LED running light and LED taillight. Where the Meteor outshines its competitors lies with the standard Tripper Navigation unit which displays turn-by-turn directions on a color gauge beside the larger analog speedometer gauge. ABS is also standard with the braking package.Due to its fanned out, well-cushioned seat, the Meteor is superbly comfortable for all-day riding. The low 29.7-inch seat height is complemented by a relaxed reach to the bars, and pegs are slightly forward for a laid-back riding position.",RE,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.7194308042526245}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9400987029075623}]"

Selling my 2007 Suzuki Boulevard C90 with only 28,944 miles and always garage kept. This bike comes with aftermarket tuned Cobra pipes, a full windshield, removable leather saddle bags, sissy seat, and a fully tightened down suspension to accommodate another rider on the back. But that's not all! The sale of the motorcycle comes with tons of freebies to sweeten the deal, including a 12V/750mA automatic battery tender trickle charger, XL sized Moto Mercenary Speed & Strength vintage zip-up hoodie with pad riding inserts, L/XL SHOEI RF-1100 Full-Face Black Helmet with Clear and Dark Lenses along with storage bag, 2 sets of protective riding gloves, one L and the other XL, a set of L/XL Duhan rechargeable heated riding gloves, 2 pairs of riding glasses with padding and UV protection, dust and windproof for day riding (dark) and night riding (yellow), one all-weather motorcycle cover, and a steering wheel bike lock. There are a few small cosmetic issues. The bike is missing a few grommets on the trim from normal wear and tear. The fuel panel doesnt lock properly but is secured with a high strength velcro. Lastly, the fuel indication flashes consistently. It is potentially a bad float unit or wiring inside the fuel tank, however the maintenance quote to troubleshoot and repair is pricey at over $500. I mitigate this by resetting the trip odometer every time I fill up. Overall range is approximately 110 miles and I always use premium gas of 91 octane or higher whenever refueling. However, the bike is recently registered in March for the next 12 months! I am selling the bike because I simply don't ride much anymore, and it is taking up space in my garage. It needs a good home. This is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on an excellent bike with all the extras you need to get started on your next adventure!

"24,240 miles","$6,800 ",GSX-R 750,  2005 Suzuki Sportbike,"Sportbike with a strong focus built up for the track. This bike has been meticulously maintained throughout it's life-span. I'm not the original owner but it has been with me since 2006 and was acquired with only 400 miles and was 100% stock at the time. Gradually the bike had been modified to be track foc  but many steps were taken to make the conversion between road legal and track prepped as easy as possible. If I recall correctly I was able to handle this in under two hours.For those that don't know, the 750 is a terrific platform for the track. It provides that extra torque in the low end so you don't need to keep it so high in the revs to power out of the corners while still being fairly light weight in comparison to the liter bikes.Included are both track and road bodies along with several fasteners and miscellaneous parts. Currently the suspension is optimized for a 180lb rider, this is however fully adjustable. Also included are the Pit Bull stands.The bike runs incredibly well and with the HM Quickshifter, it is on another level. It is currently set up in a GP shift pattern but this is very easy to change if necessary. I'd recommend leaving it that way though and making the adjustment, there's very good reason for it. Oil was just changed with Motul full synthetic. Tires are in good shape for the road with a majority of tread life left.Modifications listed below>>For the Road:Tinted windscreenFender eliminatorLED Turn SignalsLED integrated tail lightFor the Track:Aim lap timerAcumen gear indicatorAkrapovic full exhaust K&N air intakeHM QuickshifterASV LeversRace GripsDID chainVortex sprockets Vortex rearsets Vortex frame slidersVortex bar endsVortex fairing stay (for race body only)Ohlins rear ShockOhlins steering damper Racetech springs / front fork rebuild EBC front brake rotorsSteel braided brake linesSpeedscreen Amour Bodies full track bodySafety wired oil drain plug, oil filter, and oil capDriven fuel capEngine Ice coolant",SUZ,"[{'label': '4 stars', 'score': 0.5198593139648438}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6320617198944092}]"

"10,898 miles","$8,780 ",V-STROM 650XT TOURING,  2019 Suzuki Dual Sport,"I traded up in 2019 from a 2012 650xt and have been thrilled with the performance enhancements. I'm the only owner and I have baby'd this bike but of course, had to allow it to see some off road activity. Never dropped and always maintained via my local Suzuki dealer, there is still a year of extended transferable warranty left thru next spring, 2024. 2 inch riser bar mounts give it a comfortable riding position. The sit-n-fly seat cover will accompany the bike to the new owner and I would encourage using it to provide hours of saddle comfort. SW-Motech hard side bags and a Nelson-Rigg soft trunk allow enough gear for a full week trip and the Rigg tank bag is securly positioned for easy reach of the essentials you need at your fingertips. 2 ignition/gas cap/seat lock keys and 2 hard bag keys are included as well as all books and manuals. Michelin rear has 1,000 miles on it and the front Shinko, while having travelled about 2,000 still shows tons of deep tread. The Brake-Away throttle lock is highly functional and actually holds speeds more consistent than any other manual cruise control I've ever  . Upgrading to the Givi Airflow windscreen was one of my best decisions. Truly this aftermarket beauty will allow you the perfect wind shielding position for a rider of any height and any posture style.If you plan to enjoy the TAT or any offroad fun you'll appreciate the massively protective T-Rex skid plate and engine guard duo. Research will show you that the standard poly skid plate that comes as OE equipment is basically worthless. You couldn't drive a tank thru the Rex. I provided a couple of pics into the bags showing the felt lining I added. The tire plug kit is included. Fortunate for me I never had to use it. I'm sure considering making an investment like this will cause questions to surface so I'll always be available via phone, text or email. I have the title in hand so be ready with your financing in place should you choose to purchase my girl. Finally the picture of the WD40 degreaser and chain cleaner brush is to show you that after each ride during the clean up process the chain was properly cleaned and then lubed. Chain tension was checked during every service visit.Did I mention Baha driving lights?",SUZ,"[{'label': '5 stars', 'score': 0.41997385025024414}]","[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8949469327926636}]"

If someone wants a good discount on a NEW bike, I've got a pretty good offering here. I'll gladly honor the interest of a serious buyer, but otherwise I'll keep this goldilocks gem to myself when the Ad expires, Suzuki made an awesome motorcycle with this one! Why this bike over other Naked sportsbike offerings (based on my own experience with mentioned bikes);Vs. MT-10: Price and better fuel range with larger fuel tank. Power delivery is close to the smoothness of the crossplane, but very peaky with the GSX bike motor; it'll rip at the top end!Vs. MT-09: Much better fuel range still, with more power. Value is excellent for a literbike motor but a bit more expensive than Yamaha's offering.Vs. MT-07: For EXPERIENCED riders, the GSX S1000 has awesome power, there's nowhere to grow out of it except for supersports if that becomes your thing or perhaps a Hayabusa. The MT-07 is an awesome economical choice but you can only do so much with the parralel twin.Vs. CB1000: Value, pretty much. Honda's offering is also an excellent naked sportsbike, just a bit pricier.Vs. Kawasaki line: No personal experience with these, seems like they're using either a parallel twin for the smaller displacement bikes (So probably pretty good albeit limited as the MT-07) and flatplane crank four cylinder motors for their literbike naked Ninja.

But in today's market, these machines have ceded authority to larger literbikes and smaller 600s. Except, that is, for the sterling GSX-R750. A great motorcycle is all about balance, and Suzuki's all-but-invisible 750cc DOHC four has it. It packs 25 percent more displacement than a 600cc supersport motor into a package that's approximately the same size and weight. In fact, despite its displacement bump, at a claimed 419 pounds, the GSX-R750 is only 7 pounds heavier than the GSX-R600. The result is a 750cc sportbike that handles like a 600, accelerates much like a literbike, and doesn't require high revs just to cruise down the road. In engineering, the GSX-R750 and GSX-R600 are akin. Common themes include a twin-spar aluminum frame, feathery titanium valves, rider-selectable power modes, a slipper clutch that helps keep the chassis stable during quick downshifting, and plenty more goodness. If you're in the market for a 600cc supersport, ride the GSX-R750 before inking the deal. It just might convert you. Call or Text us at 415-861-6100 SF Moto is open Monday - Saturday 10 am - 6 pm.

366 miles,"$8,498 ",V-STROM 650 ABS,  2017 Suzuki Standard,"2017 Suzuki V-STROM 650 ABS, 2017 Suzuki V-Strom 650 One motorcycle that checks many of the boxes that are important to touring riders is the Suzuki V-Strom 650. With its liquid-cooled, 645cc, 90-degree V-twin lifted from the popular, budget- friendly SV650 sport standard, the V-Strom 650-affectionately known as the Wee Strom in deference to its big brother, the V-Strom 1000-is a light, affordable adventure tourer that's been a top-seller in Suzuki's lineup since it debuted for 2004. In our last full test of the V- Strom 650, back in February 2012 after the bike got its first major overhaul, we said it was the ideal do-it-all middleweight-peppy motor, rugged chassis, effortless handling, comfortable seating, 250-mile range, reasonable price. Those are admirable traits, and they still apply to the updated-for-2017 V-Strom 650. But there's something about the bike that's particularly endearing, that allows it to punch far above its weight, yet isn't easy to pin down. You won't find it in the specs or dyno chart. The V-Strom 650 is built to a price and, on Jett Tuning's dyno, the new bike made a modest 68.7 horsepower and 44.2 lb-ft of torque at the rear wheel.

It is hard to believe this is an 11 year old bike as it looks like it just rolled out of the factory yesterday. This is sure to be a future collectible being one of the first years for this generation of GSXR 750 which is the last generation there will ever be. Suzuki has already discontinued the bike in almost every other market in the world and they have said that once they cease production of this bodystyle there will never be another GSXR 750 - the most iconic superbike of all time. This bike is certainly collector quality and would score very highly on any collector assessment for originality and condition. The tank looks brand new inside which is a very important factor when considering an older Suzuki that has obviously spent a lot of its life parked up in the garage as they are notorious for getting rusty if not stored properly. Also the fork seals and factory original chain with blue master link are all like brand new. This bike is truly a time capsule back to the beginning of the bodystyle that has carried the GSXR middleweight marque all the way to present day. The only difference between a 2023 and 2011 is the paint, everything else is identical and with the Japanese jumping on the Go Green bandwagon and pledging to have 100% 0 emission moto fleets within the next 2 - 10 years there will be no more bikes like this in the future so the time to get the GSXR 750 you always dreamed of is NOW!NUMBER OF PREVIOUS OWNERS: 2CURRENT MILEAGE: 987 (May very slightly due to us test riding the bikes, generally less than 200 miles)TITLE STATUS:Clean (No Brands, No liens, Actual Mileage)ORIGINAL OWNERSHIP ITEMS INCLUDED:Spare keyUPGRAGES: NONE - 100% STOCK AND FACTORY ORIGINAL!RECENT SERVICES:Engine Oil and filter (Just performed here at our dealership at time of trade in)New tires replaced due to age (Shown with factory original tires in pictures which we kept in case a collector wants to put into a collection with all factory parts)COSMETIC IMPERFECTIONS: NONE - FLAWLESS!!!MECHANICAL IMPERFECTIONS:NONE - FLAWLESS!!!PRE-OWNED CERTIFICATION LEVEL:GOLD LEVEL CERTIFIED!WARRANTY TYPE:30 Day / 1000 mile FULL wheel to wheel no hassle warrantyPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US FOR A COPY OF OUR INDUSTRY LEADING PRE-OWNED VEHICLE QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTION CHECKLIST THAT WAS COMPLETED FOR THIS BIKE!

"9,856 miles","$2,900 ",BOULEVARD S50,  2008 Suzuki Cruiser,"Selling my 2008 Suzuki Boulevard S50. This was my first bike purchased last year from it's second owner - and has been great to learn on, but I'm looking to move to a more naked/sport style bike. Currently has 9856 miles on the clock, though this will go up a bit if the weather gets nicer.This is a great starter bike with a low (27.6 inch) seat height, with steady, predictable power from the 800cc V Twin. With the adjustable levers, low seat height, and crash bars it makes a perfect bike for shorter riders, and has been hassle free and easy to work on. I dropped it twice (gently, in the driveway both times) while learning to ride, so one of the stock levers and the crash bar have some scuffing on them. Overall the bike is in good condition, but it's 16 years old so it isn't showroom new. Looks great from 5 feet, but you can see normal scuffing and the like when you're closer. When it's cold, you do have to use the choke to get it started, but it doesn't have any trouble starting with the choke on. When it's warm, it starts normally.We changed the oil and filter with synthetic Motul 10W-40 and a K&N filter on 9/16/22 @8000 miles. Clutch and brake hydraulics were flushed and replaced 9/26/22 (we didn't record mileage on that one, but around the same as the oil and filter). New battery installed ~10/15/22. The previous owner swapped out the headlight for an LED unit (which is great, provides a lot of light at night) and added aftermarket LED rear turn signals which. really didn't fit the look of the bike. We replaced the rear signals some Kuryakin LED units which match the bike much better. The stock levers were a bit too far from the grips, and were not adjustable, so we swapped them out for purple adjustable levers. It came without a rubber piece on the shift lever, and I haven't gotten around to replacing it - though it's a $3 part you can order online.The stock quick release windshield, stock non-adjustable silver levers + a second pair of purple adjustable levers (got a second set in case I dropped the bike and bent/broke them, as they were hard to find), crash bars and saddlebags are included with the sale (the bags are in good useable shape, but show normal wear).50 cubic inch, four-stroke, liquid cooled, 45 degree V-twin, SOHC, 8-valves, TSCC5 Speed shaft drive transmission~440lbsNo trades.

"19,152 miles","$6,999 ",Boulevard M109R,  2007 Suzuki Cruiser,"Call it the best of all worlds. Suzuki's award winning Boulevard M109R - an incredible combination of cruiser styling and renowned Suzuki power and handling. By injecting the Boulevard M109R with a potent shot of race-proven technology developed for the championship-winning GSX-R sport bikes, Suzuki has literally redefined the concept of a cruiser. The Boulevard M109R's exhilarating performance begins with its all-new 109-cubic-inch, fuel injected V-twin engine. It's tuned to produce massive torque all the way from idle to redline, which translates into acceleration that you have to feel to believe - and makes this the most powerful cruiser Suzuki has ever produced. To reward every one of your senses, the big V-twin also produces a throaty, aggressive exhaust note designed to let the world know they're looking at - and listing to - the hottest cruiser on the road. Like Suzuki's sport bikes, the Boulevard M109R balances extraordinary performance with crisp handling, thanks to a technically advanced chassis and suspension, matched by world-class brakes.

I also have a passenger backrest for it. Otherwise, the bike is totally stock. This is the deluxe version which includes two tone paint and some special embossing on the seat. There is some glue residue from a police association sticker that was on the rear fender and it could use a good polishing all over. Ive tried to show a true representation of the condition in the photos. If I get time, I may try to shine it up a bit more. Probably not. I have a clean title in my name.

The GSX-S1000GT+'s performance is a revelation, its appearance breathtaking, and the Suzuki mySPIN connectivity application integrated into the full-color TFT instrument panel provides easy access to contacts, maps, music, and phone communication.;;Using long-stroke, GSX-R engine architecture, the 999cc four-stroke, liquid-cooled DOHC in-line four engine delivers smooth, consistent power throughout its wide power band.

Refined and controlled performance is managed by Suzuki Intelligent Ride System (S.I.R.S.) technology, including electronic cruise control, traction control* and clutchless quick shifting, so passing slower traffic is an opportunity, never a challenge.;;The twin-spar aluminum frame and superbike-braced swingarm help deliver agile handling and great road-holding ability that will go the distance. Visually stunning, the trellis-style sub-frame design creates secure attachment points for the standard, high capacity 25.7L saddlebags, while allowing for a thick, more comfortable passenger seat. The GSX-S1000GT+'s cargo capacity and suspension control can flex to each new destination, thanks to its fully adjustable, inverted KYB fork and easy-to-adjust rear shock. The dual, ABS-equipped**, radial-mounted, four-piston, Brembo-front brake calipers and 310mm floating rotors provide the controlled stopping performance needed to travel two-up with confidence.;;Comfort is vital to miles of effortless performance, and the GSX-S1000GT+ is ready to accept your next long ride.

At speed, push a button and the windshield raises to tuck you into an air pocket of smooth quiet riding. Twist her knob and she'll warm your hands on her bars, which are raised to the perfect position by added bar risers. A RAM Mount ball was added to her stem bolt, from which you can attach a variety of custom accessories like a phone or GPS mount.

This Bike is Brand New ALWAYS GARAGED, I would not sell this but my work is moving me overseas in 2024. I have 36 miles on this never crashed. I was planning on putting more extras but I only got a quad lock phone holder with wireless charger ran to the battery. The brand new MSRP is 9,999.00 after you pay all dealership fees and registration your not leaving there for less than 12,000 out the door. I also purchased the 5 year warranty which is transferable and obvously included here. I also am willing to include a BRAND NEW SHOEI GT Air 2 Helmet bought same time as Bike, size Large and matte Black. It is one of the very best on the market. I am including the Built in SENA Head Set worth 385$ and the helmet was 750$ over a 1,000$ value included with a 2,000$ 5 year Yamaha warranty value added to the already LIKE NEW Bike with 36 miles. This is an absolute steal if you want this bike. Below is the description of this bike. For the first time since its introduction in 2016, the retro-styled Yamaha XSR900 has received its first facelift in the form of an aesthetic redesign. Want a new bike that ? The 2022 XSR900 is the perfect balance of modern performance and classic Japanese-styled 1980s Sportster. The XSR900 already looked old to begin with thanks to its seat and single head-lamp lighting configuration, but Yamaha has decided to crank the Retro knob up to an insane degree for 2022. The new XSR900 boasts a brand new box-style bench seat (it looks much older, go figure), among some other small changes. The visual changes are nice, but the performance changes are where you will find the real selling point for this newly updated retro-sportster. Mandatory Brembo radial master cylinder brakes, fully adjustable inverted KYB forks, updated front air intake, and a brand new 889cc transverse triple engine borrowed from the recently overhauled MT-09 are all neatly packaged into a completely redesigned Deltabox frame which allows for better maneuverability thanks to some weight-saving magic. Powering this new (but old) bike is a EU5 889cc CP3 motor shared with a few other Yamaha models. It produces 117 horsepower and 68.5 lb-ft of torque.

,"$4,500 ",YSR50,  1987 Yamaha Classic / Vintage,"Hi, I am selling my 1987 Yamaha YSR 50 mini bike. I feel like it is better than new, because many hours and dollars have been spent converting it into a competition race bike for the local go cart track. It is fun for adults and kids to ride this motorcycle at the race track. I bought this motorcycle from a friend who was a professional motorcycle mechanic who rebuilt the motor for himself to race for fun. I recently finished restoring it with:-New lightweight fiberglass race body work.-New professional paint job on the bodywork.-New decals on the bodywork.-New wind screen.-Newer Dunlop racing tires.-Fresh oil change with Motul oil.-Fresh air filter with Maxima Pro Filter.-Fresh full tank of premium gas and Maxima 2 stroke oil.Many of the heavy parts have been removed to make the bike lighter weight for racing so it is now push start, but it is easy to push start because it is a 50cc engine. I like to save us both time by telling you both the good and bad things, so here are the bad things: It is not street legal anymore, but in case you want to convert it back to I have the pink slip at hand. I got a small crack in the brand new windscreen when I was installing in the cold but I glued it back together with a strong glue. The professional painter put a hairline crack in the front body work when it was at his paint shop, but it still seems strong and not all the way through the bodywork. The red color on the bodywork, stickers, and rims are not the exact matching color of red. Much of the bike is original from 1987 so there is some light wear and tear.This bike is ready to ride if you are ready. This bike starts and runs probably better than new.

It's torque is amazing, better hang on!The Vance Hines Exhaust is not just beautiful, but the sound wildly ferocious! This baby is black and tons of chrome, truly an eye catcher anywhere you ride. The reliabilty, power and overall ability in mountain drives, highway cruises or local show stoppers are its greatest attributes. It gets 42 mpg and every mile is in style. Maintenance, insurance and overall performance is so inexpensive. Just put brand new Metzler tires, rear brakes, extra chrome accsessories and complete service to safely start your journey and ownership of this bike I love. I would never sell it but my wife, dog and I are getting older, so doing the travel trailer thing now. You want a ride that everyone looks at, that is incredible and can be customized to your desires with all that you could need? This is your ride! Sissy bar and rack, mini windsheild to leave on or remove. Weekender sissy bar travel bag, extra like new helmets and riding gear included. I'm telling you, you can't find a better do it all bike. She's precious to me and will be to you! LAST BUT NOT LEAST. My favorite dirt bike was the Husqvarna Enduro 250. I owned and rode a Herritage Harley Springer with style and a rear end that was incredible. On a thousand mile trip of open highway my Harley Road King was possibly more comfortable.

This bike is much faster than it has a right to be given its diminutive size, very low price point, and its target audience being novice riders looking for a friendly and easy to ride sportbike that's as comfortable as it is fast. The reality is Yamaha paid up on the promises they made about the bike being easy to ride and extremely comfortable as well as having an excellent power to weight ratio. The only thing Yamaha left out in their ads for the bike is that this is truly a wolf in sheeps clothing similar to its absolutely mental brother the FZ09. This bike will be an absolute hooligan willing to loft the front or rear wheel any time with some serious provocation. That is what has made these bikes SOOOOOOO popular and gain such a cult following, Yamaha truly started making bikes with deep character again and it shows in the sales figures. These are budget bikes that have excellent build quality, reliability and chassis and motors that are advanced enough for track days and stunt sessions as well as the week long commute and weekend blitzkrieg down your favorite local backroad. This particular example is ultra clean and minty fresh and needs nothing more than a new owner for the upcoming amazing weather as we enter the east coast riding season. This is a gorgeous bike and the color must be seen in person to fully appreciate.NUMBER OF PREVIOUS OWNERS:CURRENT MILEAGE:18142 (May very slightly due to us test riding the bikes, generally less than 200 miles)TITLE STATUS:Clean (No Brands, No liens, Actual Mileage)ORIGINAL OWNERSHIP ITEMS INCLUDED:UPGRAGES:Fender eliminator kitIntegrated tail lightStomp grip tank padsPuig touring windscreenFrame slidersAdjustable leversRECENT SERVICES:Engine Oil and filter (Just performed here at our dealership at time of trade in)COSMETIC IMPERFECTIONS:NONE - FLAWLESS!!!MECHANICAL IMPERFECTIONS:NONE - FLAWLESS!!!PRE-OWNED CERTIFICATION LEVEL:GOLD LEVEL CERTIFIED!WARRANTY TYPE:30 Day / 1000 mile FULL wheel to wheel no hassle warrantyPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US FOR A COPY OF OUR INDUSTRY LEADING PRE-OWNED VEHICLE QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTION CHECKLIST THAT WAS COMPLETED FOR THIS BIKE!
