When I purchased it, it had 6872 miles and now it has 7,783. It's been garage kept and has never been down. It starts every time and on the first attempt, and it runs like a beast. If you know, you know. This is one of the best sounding motorcycles you can own. Hearing the engine rev makes the hair on neck stand up. I never entered the bike in any shows, but the previous owner did and won a couple of first place awards in the Best of Modern Italian Motorcycle category (Included). The bike is currently registered in CA for 2023. The buyer will receive both Black Keys and the infamous RED KEY along with the KEY CODE CARD which contains the electronic code and the mechanical code for the motorcycle. I think the red key is about $500 to replace so don't lose it. The bike has upgraded exhaust pipes and fold down mirrors. It also has front light screen protector and solo single seat conversion with rear cowl which adds a clean smooth aerodynamic racing profile to the look. The racing number 7 reflects the year the model year of 2007. Please see the attached invoice the last service I did at my Ducati dealer. The total invoice as $2,152.14. I had brought the bike in because it wasn't turning over. Apparently it had been sitting for too long and the gas had gone bad. The invoice provides a detailed account of everything that was done. It's in excellent condition from top to bottom. Tires were replaced about two years ago and are in excellent condition as well. The bike is located in Beverly Hills CA. These GT100 models were only produced between 2007 and 2010 and are highly sought after which means you’re almost certain to recoup your purchase price should you ever choose to sell this highly collectable bike.Here’s a link if you’d like to read more about this model. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati_SportClassic The reason I’m selling is that I just have too many bikes and not enough time to ride them. Additionally, I’ve been doing a lot more adventure riding the past few years which included a RTW trip in 2017 and completing the Trans America Trial in 2020. I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have and take and post additional photos or videos of anything you'd like to see. Kind regards,Mikemikewinn100@gmail.com"

The riding position has been thoroughly revised for the utmost riding fun and control. The new Hypermotard 950 sports a new, more open handlebar, narrower side profile and a new Hypermotard 950 seat, featuring a flat, extended profile and a moderate bulge in the passenger area for improved comfort.

For 2021 Ducati presents the Streetfighter V4 S in a new Dark Stealth color scheme, which joins the sporty Ducati Red.The Panigale V4 stripped of its fairings and with high-and-wide handlebar. This is the design concept behind the new Streetfighter V4, a bike that can amplify the emotions of its rider and make them feel like the leader of the pack on every outing on the road. The result is an unrivalled, contemporary, technology-packed naked bike, with a powerful and exciting design that does nothing to hide its performance.Fast, agile mixed-road performance demands maximum stability at high speed and when braking, reduced wheel-up during acceleration and minimized electronic control of the suspension set-up: that's why Ducati Corse specialists have, together with the Ducati Style Centre, developed biplane wings for the Streetfighter V4.The aerodynamics were developed using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation. The calculation method involved stationary simulation of flow and pressure to achieve increased downforce, especially on the front wheel."

ADULT OWNED, NO ACCIDENTS OR DROPS. Beautiful bike with a fantastic riding position and crazy torque. Serious eye turner. Let me know any questions you have!2015 Ducati Diavel Carbon Star White and Matt Carbon ""Don't call me a cruiser"" The Diavel Carbon exemplifies the distinctive style and sporty soul of the Diavel with high-quality, light-weight components. Clad with carbon fiber and Marchesini forged wheels, weight is reduced to just 205 kg, only further enhancing the performance of this extraordinary motorcycle.The intoxicating design, with innovative LED headlight, and refined rider comfort of the new Diavel may imply ""cruiser,"" but the brute force of its 162 hp Testastretta engine and its razor sharp handling prove otherwise.Power and Torque With its 162hp and colossal 96lb-ft of torque, the Diavel Testastretta 11° DS engine defines authentic Ducati Desmodromic performance. Thanks to dual spark plugs, high-compression pistons, and revised injection spray targeting, the engine's torque curve is strong and smooth at low rpm, and remains so through a wide rev-range. The engine output is managed by Ducati's Ride-by-Wire (RbW) system to ensure effortless ridability, with plenty of power on tap also for high-rpm riding. Twin lateral radiators To keep the frontal lines of the Diavel clean, the technical solution of a highly efficient lateral radiator is placed on each side of the bike. These well-ducted units, located beneath the fuel tank, use aerodynamics to help draw cooling air flow through them and are assisted by high-flow electric fans when required. Their shape integrates seamlessly with the overall design, combining form and function to enhance the muscular presence of the bike.Ergonomics The redesigned, more comfortable seat offers more room and has a low height of 770 mm, which allows for extended hours of riding pleasure and makes the Diavel accessible to a wide range of riders. A relaxed handlebar position sits naturally in the rider's reach, ensuring full control and comfort with the unmatched coolness of cruiser style. Marzocchi forks with low-friction fork legs The Diavel uses 50 mm Marzocchi front forks with fork legs finished in low-friction diamond-like carbon (DLC). These forks are fully adjustable for spring pre-load and compression."

Wide, tapered section handlebars transfer control of the tarmac to the rider and a full length seat eases fore and aft movement – up front when entering the turns, then slide back for maximum traction on exit.A rigidly triangulated trellis frame and track-tested chassis geometry is matched with state-of-the-art suspension. Start off with the road-holding prowess of huge 50 millimeter Marzocchi forks, gripped by a triple screw lower fork crown. These cartridge damper forks work as impressively as they look, with special high rigidity stainless steel sliders and external adjustability for compression and rebound damping, plus spring pre-load. The rear suspension performs with equal precision by using a fully adjustable ZF Sachs shock mounted to a robust single-sided swingarm.Light Marchesini wheels mounted on large diameter axles are fitted with the latest Z-rated Bridgestone BT014 tires sporting a fat 180/55 section on the rear. Stopping power is controlled by twin radially mounted Brembo four piston calipers gripping new lightweight 305 millimeter twin discs up front, and a 245 millimeter disc at the rear to make stopping as thrilling as gassing it.The new 1100 Desmo engine pumps out potent torque and horsepower. Twist the throttle and no matter the rpm, fuel injected power is at the rider’s command. The lightweight, 90 degree twin stands at the pinnacle of more than three decades of Desmo air-cooled development. One ride makes it clear why the 1100 engine has charmed journalists worldwide. This is the perfect motorcycle engine."

C&J DUCATI 900 Lightweight Special, 1 of 3 Built, Rare!This motorcycle is one of the most unique Ducatis ever to be offered for sale. This is one of three produced by Mark Henry and C&J Racing Frames in 1987. The inspiration was the new, at that time, Ducati F-1 which offered state of the art styling and handling but an engine that was considerably cheapened when compared to the labor intensive, traditional, old world craftsmanship of the bevel drive desmo engines like the one that took Mike Hailwood to victory at the Isle of Man TT races a few years earlier.The C&J frame is carefully designed and constructed of high quality, light weight, 4130 chrome moly tubing. C&J achieved a very strong and light structure. The frame also has some nice features. The steering head angle is steeper and adjustable in a 2* range to get the feel that you like. The rear suspension is a mono-shock design that reduces the wheelbase considerably to 58 inches for fast steering.The fiberglass tank, tail section, fender, and fairing are the highest quality products you will ever see. Mark Henry had these carefully made at Fiber Systems, his company. The custom paint work in pearl white and green metallic with black striping is stunning.Suspension on this bike is upgraded to the highest spec adjustable Marzocchi M1R front forks and Works Performance aluminum remote reservoir mono-shock.Braking is handled by top of the line Brembo gold components up front featuring twin floating discs and 4 piston race spec calipers. Rear braking also features quality Brembo parts.Real Marvic magnesium wheels are mounted, front and rear. Very light weight!Other features are custom billet aluminum triple clamps with the lower clamp acting as a brake line junction, genuine Ducati gauges and switchgear, Ducati F-1 foot controls, and custom Bub exhaust.Engine number 086784 has around 50 miles on it since a complete rebuild by Dr. Desmo of Evanston IL. The displacement is 905cc(88mmx74.4mm) and I have 8, hand written pages of assembly notes with dimensions that are included. Features noted are 42mm and 38mm mille valves, aluminum clutch kit, stainless screw set, gear gazer, heavy breather, aluminum oil filter cover, aluminum tower tubes, and lightened clutch assembly.In June of 1987 Motorcyclist magazine did a feature article on the personal C&J Ducati of creator Mark Henry. The 4 page article by Nick Ienatsch was very complimentary. “It’s an easy bike to ride briskly; the legendary Ducati power pushing a substantially lighter bike...” “This theme is echoed in the fairing and tank, in the big 900 mill enclosed in a maze of chrome-moly tubing, in the bike’s cornering performance and even in it’s braking abilities. It’s a sound principle.” Nick raved about the handlin"

At 369 pounds (168 kilograms) the 848 is an amazing 44 pounds (20 kilograms) lighter than its predecessor, and a significant 11 pounds (5 kilograms) lighter than its larger capacity brother, the 1098.The highly advanced 848 engine uses an improved method of engine case production in which cases are vacuum die-cast formed. While providing significant weight savings of more than 6.5 pounds (3 kilograms), this method also ensures consistent wall thickness and increased strength. Further refinements include a sophisticated wet clutch that offers 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) less weight, a much higher service life, improved clutch feel and quiet operation.With the first twist of the wrist, the powerful rush of the Testastretta Evoluzione engine confirms that the rules have changed. The 848's 134 horsepower is not only 30 percent more powerful than its predecessor, but it provides a power-to-weight ratio even better than the potent 999.The 848 - a new class of Superbikes."
