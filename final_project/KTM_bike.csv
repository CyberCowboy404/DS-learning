"5,796 miles","$10,999 ",SMC 690 R,  2019 KTM Super Moto,"I purchased this 2019 KTM SMCR 690 last year with 5700 miles on it. I have only put 100 miles on the bike and, unfortunately, am forced to sell the bike due to an impending neck surgery that will not allow me to ride motorcycles for a while. I have ridden Kawasaki, Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha, Ducati, and KTM bikes and have never ridden anything this enthusiastic. At only 306 lbs dry, this thing is so flickable and truly is a wheelie monster. The front wheel lifts easily with the flick of your wrist. If that’s your thing, the SMCR 690 will not disappoint.The previous owner had a gentle lay down in a parking and left a little bit of rash on the right handguard, clutch, front fork knuckle, and ever so slight rash on the swingarm. He also stripped the graphics and painted the bike black. The very minor damage does not affect how the bike rides at all. I have had it inspected by KTM to ensure that it was safe to ride and have had most of the rash fixed.While the black did look menacing, it needed a little something else so I spruced it up with a brand new graphics kit. The swingarm hardly had any rash, which I covered up with some swingarm sliders. The handguards were replaced with OEM KTM handguards. Rather than purchasing a new clutch cover due to the rash on the bottom, I purchased a KTM power parts carbon fiber clutch cover so it does need a new clutch cover if you want to take the carbon fiber cover off (but why would you do that?) Finally, the most rash is on the front fork knuckle which, unfortunately, cannot be replaced without replacing the entire fork. Now that the bad is out of the way, let’s get to the good (or great). I have added a number of upgrades making this, in my humble opinion, one of the best looking KTM SMC R 690’s out there. Here’s a list of all of the upgrades:In preparation for the sale, I have performed the following maintenance:CLEAN TITLE. (214)-799-9116"
485 miles,"$9,500 ",350 EXC-F,  2018 KTM Dual Sport,"KTM 350 EXC-F is based largely on the 2016 SX models, but featuring lighter, more compact engines that improve power delivery. While described as a “dual sport,” these bikes are essentially racing dirt bikes with turn signals and a provision for a license plate. I am the original owner and bike is “barely ridden” with under 500 miles on the odometer.The 350-cc four-stroke fuel-injected single-cylinder engine knocked almost 4.5 pounds off of the engine of the SX series bikes. The manufacturer describes as the most perfectly balanced powerplant. These bikes feature a Keihin Engine Management System with a 42-mm throttle body and separate circuits for cold start and idle adjustments. The engine starts easily on the electric start, and runs perfectly. The bike has a six-speed manual gearbox sourced from PANKL Racing Systems, which allows the bike to have the highest durability and reliability level. No leaks from the engine or the gearbox.Bodywork consists of a headlight bucket, front and rear fenders, and side panels, all molded in orange and black plastic with vinyl KTM graphics. The bike shows no signs of damage to the bodywork, on the fender edges, or the sides. The body covers a 2.245-gallon fuel tank made of translucent plastic for easy fuel level visibility. The only modification the seller points out is the addition of plastic handguards that are mounted to a cast-aluminum frame. The seat is a black, grippy vinyl, which allows significant range of motion when seated or standing on the pegs. The upholstery has no damage, the handgrips is in good condition, and the ends of the brake and clutch levers have no damage from falls. Both the brake pedal and the shifter lever, and the bear-trap footpegs, are in good shape. The only gauge is a small digital meter with a speedometer readout and odometer showing 485 miles. The EXC-F chassis is lightweight chromoly steel, while the rear subframe is aluminum and weighs just 900 grams. The 260-mm front and 220-mm rear disc brakes, and the black aluminum spoked wheels, are reported to be from the factory. The wheels are equipped with new racing tires as new, and the original never   are also available. DOCUMENTATION - Directly owned, will be sold on a clean New York title . Four-stroke dual sport motorcycles like this 2017 KTM 350 EXC-F provide the light weight and agility of a dirt bike, with the required equipment for legal registration in all 50 states. This example appears to be in nearly new condition."

For the first time, it offers Bosch's new MSC (Motorcycle Stability Control). MSC enhances the existing package consisting of lean-sensitive traction control and ABS featuring a combined braking function with a world first: the first ever lean-sensitive cornering ABS. As ever, it sets standards in the travel segment: 150 hp with a weight of only 230 kg fully tanked combine to produce a power-to-weight ratio previously unheard of in this class and therefore delivering unrivalled ride dynamics. At the same time, the powerful, economical and cultivated engine enables either particularly relaxed and comfortable riding or, if required, super-sporty propulsion with every conceivable level in between. The chassis combines lightness with outstanding geometry and fantastic suspension, which, together with completely new tires for the travel enduro class, allow undreamed of riding pleasure in all conditions and whatever speed you desire.Although substantially more powerful and equipped more comprehensively, the 1190 Adventure consumes about 20 per cent less fuel than its predecessor with an impressive 23-litre tank capacity.A unique mix of the highest quality components combined with a fully developed and reliable engine allows extremely long service intervals of 15,000 kmThe guarantee for smooth throttle response, not just no throttle control cable: The 1190 Adventure's ride-by-wire system ensures perfect application of the readily available and plentiful torque. It also electronically translates the throttle commands of the rider into throttle valve positions perfectly suited to the riding conditions. The DBW system is fully compliant with the s"

There is a small scuff on the left engine guard that can't even be seen unless you get Macro (pic). No chips! I also learned that the touring cases are flexible plastic so the aluminum panel removes and it is solid plastic behind it. Leaning the bike on the case did not damage the case or dent the structure, only the aluminum shield and you can't even see (pics). Great bike! You will not be disappointed!"

Below is a list of all the modifications and their MSRP price, an added value of over $6,000. Most notable of the changes would be the rally fairing with crazy bright head lights, the Rottweiler intake system and Powercommander combo bringing the total horsepower of the bike to just under 80hp, and the heavier weight fork and shock springs to accommodate my weight (200lbs) and added gear while touring. Comes with nearly all stock parts, a few extra upgrades, loads of fluids and cleaners, various tools, a cover and the bin to put them all in.- Brittanica Composites Lynx R (High Output) Fairing: $1092.00 MSRP- GPR V4 Stabilizer: $525.00 MSRP- Acerbis Supermoto Fender: $26.00 MSRP- KTM Heated Grips: $100.00 MSRP- Reflex Racing Handlebar Guards: $196.00 MSRP- Rottweiler Performance Intake System: $399.95 MSRP- Rottweiler Fueling Dongle: $39.95 MSRP- Rottweiler Canister Valve Removal Kit: $29.95 MSRP- Rottweiler Performance Internal Soft Bag: $59.00 MSRP- Dynojet Power Commander V w/ Power & Economy Maps: $520.00 MSRP- Dynojet PCV Map Switch: $55.95 MSRP- Safari 3.7 Gal Auxiliary Fuel Tank: $531.00 MSRP- Perun Moto Subframe Reinforcement Kit: $74.00- Factory Pro Shift Kit: $109.95 MSRP- Aluminum Skid Plate: $100.00 MSRP- Kouba Lowering Link (not installed): $179.00 MSRP- Rox Speed FX 2” Pivoting Handlebar Risers: $100.00 MSRP- Happy Trails SU Side Rack: $228.20 MSRP- Happy Trails OWYHEE 27 Liter Aluminum Panniers: $441.93 MSRP- Happy Trails Trail Plate System: $296.44 MSRP- Happy Trails 33 Liter Aluminum Top Box: $248.40 MSRP- IMS Rally Footpegs: $200.00 MSRP- Enduro Engineering .62 Fork Springs: $145.00 MSRP- Enduro Engineering 9.6 Shock Springs: $145.00 MSRP- X-Trig Pre-load Adjuster: $189.99 MSRP- Pazzo Racing Adjustable Brake and Clutch Levers: $200.00"

I bought this bike when i had a lot of time on my hands but the next week after purchasing the bike i got a new job that takes up all my time. Now the bike sits in my garage taking up space. The bike has 105 miles!!!! yes it hasn't been broken into yet, its the only 790 on the market to have 105 miles. I removed all the stock decals to give it the all black sleek look but if you like decals its ready for a new decal sticker kit. I also up graded the handle bars to pro taper evo bars for better comfort but if you dont like them i also have the stock handle bars. As you can see this bike has an upgraded tail tidy, the stock one sticks out way too far and i think everyone can agree this tail tidy is way sleeker. Also upgraded the handle bar grips and i have 2 brand new handle bar mirrors and i have a brand new 2 finger clutch lever that i have not installed yet cause i have been swamped with work. When i purchased the bike at the dealership they already installed these ugly crash bars on it so i just left them on for protection until i got a crash cage but never came down to it. The specs on this bike are crazy it has 4 different ride modes Street, Track, Sport and rain its also has launch control & one of the best specs would be the quick shifter and your able to turn it off and on with a press of a button theirs so many other specs on this bike. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to know more about the bike. 1st owner & i have the pink slip on hand."

The bike has 222 miles on the odometer and a total of 11 hours riding time. The bike has never been in any accidents. It hasn’t even fallen over. I would rate the condition of the bike as mint or near-showroom condition. I’ve been the only rider on the bike and most of my riding was done in open fields and gravel roads. The bike has seen very little highway use and it’s never been raced. The bike needs a quick wash to remove some mild dust and dirt. It’s currently registered in the state of Virginia but needs a current Virginia safety inspection. I’m certain it will pass a safety inspection and can make the sale contingent on a current inspection if that is a concern. The bike has had the 600-mile service. The service was performed by the KTM dealer MotoMember in Purcellville, VA. The bike has been lightly ridden and well-maintained.Specifications:ENGINE: BORE (MM) 88COMPRESSION RATIO 12.3:1COOLING LiquidDISPLACEMENT IN CC 349.7DISPLACEMENT IN CI 21.3ENGINE TYPE Single-CylinderSTARTER ElectricSTROKE 57.5VALVE CONFIGURATIONS SOHC TRANSMISSION:NUMER OF SPEEDS 6TRANSMISSION TYPE Manual TIRES: FRONT TIRE Continental TKC 80 90/90 R21REAR TIRE Continental TKC 80 120/100 R18 BRAKES: FRONT BRAKE DIAMETER 260FRONT BRAKE TYPE Hydraulic DiscREAR BRAKE DIAMETER 8.7REAR BRAKE TYPE REAR Hydraulic DiscSUSPENSION & STEERING: AIR ADJUSTABLE NoFRONT SUSPENSION BRAND NAME WPFRONT SUSPENSION TYPE Inverted ForkREAR ADJUSTABLE REBOUND DAMPING YesREAR ADJUSTABLE SHOCK / SPRING PRE-LOAD YesREAR SUSPENSION BRAND NAME WPSUSPENSION TYPE Twin Sided Swing ArmSEAT HEIGHT (IN) 37.8OTHER:FUEL CAPACITY (GAL) 2.3MANUFACTURER COUNTRY AustriaMANUFACTURER TYPE EnduroDRY WEIGHT (LBS) 237WHEELBASE (IN) 58.3The bike comes with everything that I received when I purchased it including owner’s manual, tools, etc. Also includes extra tools and parts such as an extra KTM OEM seat; The 15mm lower seat installed; original seat included, Enduro Engineering Aluminum Rear Disc Brake Fin, Two skid plates--one KTM OEM and one aftermarket; New aftermarket Lithium-Ion battery installed and original KTM OEM battery that still holds a charge;"

KTM s first single-cylinder street bike grew into a cult classic, adding extreme fun to a raw and radical concept. Today s 690 DUKE stays faithful to its ancestor s ways, but adds future-proof refinements: impressive smoothness, sophisticated electronics, improved ergonomics and tons of grunt. This firmly cements the world s strongest single-cylinder production motorcycle at the cutting edge of engineering. Long live the Duke! The brilliant LC4 showcases twenty-four carats of fun. With its powerful, lightweight single combined with a sophisticated electronic engine management , dual-spark ignition with plug-selective mappings and a second balancer shaft, the results are top refinement, a wide powerband and a full 54 kW (73 hp) of peak power. Despite its pronounced lust for cornering, the 690 Duke also presents versatile real-world capabilities. On a daily basis, particularly the two-piece seat will prove a valuable friend.
