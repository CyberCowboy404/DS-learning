This is an absolute steal if you want this bike. Below is the description of this bike. For the first time since its introduction in 2016, the retro-styled Yamaha XSR900 has received its first facelift in the form of an aesthetic redesign. Want a new bike that ? The 2022 XSR900 is the perfect balance of modern performance and classic Japanese-styled 1980’s Sportster. The XSR900 already looked old to begin with thanks to its seat and single head-lamp lighting configuration, but Yamaha has decided to crank the Retro knob up to an insane degree for 2022. The new XSR900 boasts a brand new box-style bench seat (it looks much older, go figure), among some other small changes. The visual changes are nice, but the performance changes are where you will find the real selling point for this newly updated retro-sportster. Mandatory Brembo radial master cylinder brakes, fully adjustable inverted KYB forks, updated front air intake, and a brand new 889cc transverse triple engine borrowed from the recently overhauled MT-09 are all neatly packaged into a completely redesigned Deltabox frame which allows for better maneuverability thanks to some weight-saving magic. Powering this new (but old) bike is a EU5 889cc CP3 motor shared with a few other Yamaha models. It produces 117 horsepower and 68.5 lb-ft of torque. Although it looks old, this updated XSR is a breath of fresh air for their 2022 motorcycle model lineup."

,"$4,500 ",YSR50,  1987 Yamaha Classic / Vintage,"Hi, I am selling my 1987 Yamaha YSR 50 mini bike. I feel like it is better than new, because many hours and dollars have been spent converting it into a competition race bike for the local go cart track. It is fun for adults and kids to ride this motorcycle at the race track. I bought this motorcycle from a friend who was a professional motorcycle mechanic who rebuilt the motor for himself to race for fun. I recently finished restoring it with:-New lightweight fiberglass race body work.-New professional paint job on the bodywork.-New decals on the bodywork.-New wind screen.-Newer Dunlop racing tires.-Fresh oil change with Motul oil.-Fresh air filter with Maxima Pro Filter.-Fresh full tank of premium gas and Maxima 2 stroke oil.Many of the heavy parts have been removed to make the bike lighter weight for racing so it is now push start, but it is easy to push start because it is a 50cc engine. I like to save us both time by telling you both the good and bad things, so here are the bad things: It is not street legal anymore, but in case you want to convert it back to I have the pink slip at hand. I got a small crack in the brand new windscreen when I was installing in the cold but I glued it back together with a strong glue. The professional painter put a hairline crack in the front body work when it was at his paint shop, but it still seems strong and not all the way through the bodywork. The red color on the bodywork, stickers, and rims are not the exact matching color of red. Much of the bike is original from 1987 so there is some light wear and tear.This bike is ready to ride if you are ready. This bike starts and runs probably better than new. If you are interested in this rare motorcycle that may even go up in value, give me a call. Thanks, Pete"

Maintenance, insurance and overall performance is so inexpensive. Just put brand new Metzler tires, rear brakes, extra chrome accsessories and complete service to safely start your journey and ownership of this bike I love. I would never sell it but my wife, dog and I are getting older, so doing the travel trailer thing now.

Sissy bar and rack, mini windsheild to leave on or remove. Weekender sissy bar travel bag, extra like new helmets and riding gear included. I'm telling you, you can't find a better do it all bike.

This bike is much faster than it has a right to be given its diminutive size, very low price point, and its target audience being novice riders looking for a friendly and easy to ride sportbike that's as comfortable as it is fast. The reality is Yamaha paid up on the promises they made about the bike being easy to ride and extremely comfortable as well as having an excellent power to weight ratio. The only thing Yamaha left out in their ads for the bike is that this is truly a wolf in sheeps clothing similar to its absolutely mental brother the FZ09. This bike will be an absolute hooligan willing to loft the front or rear wheel any time with some serious provocation. That is what has made these bikes SOOOOOOO popular and gain such a cult following, Yamaha truly started making bikes with deep character again and it shows in the sales figures. These are budget bikes that have excellent build quality, reliability and chassis and motors that are advanced enough for track days and stunt sessions as well as the week long commute and weekend blitzkrieg down your favorite local backroad. This particular example is ultra clean and minty fresh and needs nothing more than a new owner for the upcoming amazing weather as we enter the east coast riding season. This is a gorgeous bike and the color must be seen in person to fully appreciate.NUMBER OF PREVIOUS OWNERS:CURRENT MILEAGE:18142 (May very slightly due to us test riding the bikes, generally less than 200 miles)TITLE STATUS:Clean (No Brands, No liens, Actual Mileage)ORIGINAL OWNERSHIP ITEMS INCLUDED:UPGRAGES:Fender eliminator kitIntegrated tail lightStomp grip tank padsPuig touring windscreenFrame slidersAdjustable leversRECENT SERVICES:Engine Oil and filter (Just performed here at our dealership at time of trade in)COSMETIC IMPERFECTIONS:NONE - FLAWLESS!!!MECHANICAL IMPERFECTIONS:NONE - FLAWLESS!!!PRE-OWNED CERTIFICATION LEVEL:GOLD LEVEL CERTIFIED!WARRANTY TYPE:30 Day / 1000 mile FULL wheel to wheel no hassle warrantyPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US FOR A COPY OF OUR INDUSTRY LEADING PRE-OWNED VEHICLE QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTION CHECKLIST THAT WAS COMPLETED FOR THIS BIKE!
