Selling my 2007 Suzuki Boulevard C90 with only 28,944 miles and always garage kept. This bike comes with aftermarket tuned Cobra pipes, a full windshield, removable leather saddle bags, sissy seat, and a fully tightened down suspension to accommodate another rider on the back. But that's not all! The sale of the motorcycle comes with tons of freebies to sweeten the deal, including a 12V/750mA automatic battery tender trickle charger, XL sized Moto Mercenary Speed & Strength vintage zip-up hoodie with pad riding inserts, L/XL SHOEI RF-1100 Full-Face Black Helmet with Clear and Dark Lenses along with storage bag, 2 sets of protective riding gloves, one L and the other XL, a set of L/XL Duhan rechargeable heated riding gloves, 2 pairs of riding glasses with padding and UV protection, dust and windproof for day riding (dark) and night riding (yellow), one all-weather motorcycle cover, and a steering wheel bike lock. There are a few small cosmetic issues. The bike is missing a few grommets on the trim from normal wear and tear. The fuel panel doesn’t lock properly but is secured with a high strength velcro. Lastly, the fuel indication flashes consistently. It is potentially a bad float unit or wiring inside the fuel tank, however the maintenance quote to troubleshoot and repair is pricey at over $500. I mitigate this by resetting the trip odometer every time I fill up. Overall range is approximately 110 miles and I always use premium gas of 91 octane or higher whenever refueling. However, the bike is recently registered in March for the next 12 months! I am selling the bike because I simply don't ride much anymore, and it is taking up space in my garage. It needs a good home. This is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on an excellent bike with all the extras you need to get started on your next adventure! Contact me today to schedule a viewing and test drive (must have cash in hand, you break it or put it down, you buy it). Asking price is $4,200. Don't miss out on this amazing deal!"

"24,240 miles","$6,800 ",GSX-R 750,  2005 Suzuki Sportbike,"Sportbike with a strong focus built up for the track. This bike has been meticulously maintained throughout it's life-span. I'm not the original owner but it has been with me since 2006 and was acquired with only 400 miles and was 100% stock at the time. Gradually the bike had been modified to be track foc  but many steps were taken to make the conversion between road legal and track prepped as easy as possible. If I recall correctly I was able to handle this in under two hours.For those that don't know, the 750 is a terrific platform for the track. It provides that extra torque in the low end so you don't need to keep it so high in the revs to power out of the corners while still being fairly light weight in comparison to the liter bikes.Included are both track and road bodies along with several fasteners and miscellaneous parts. Currently the suspension is optimized for a 180lb rider, this is however fully adjustable. Also included are the Pit Bull stands.The bike runs incredibly well and with the HM Quickshifter, it is on another level. It is currently set up in a GP shift pattern but this is very easy to change if necessary. I'd recommend leaving it that way though and making the adjustment, there's very good reason for it. Oil was just changed with Motul full synthetic. Tires are in good shape for the road with a majority of tread life left.Modifications listed below>>For the Road:Tinted windscreenFender eliminatorLED Turn SignalsLED integrated tail lightFor the Track:Aim lap timerAcumen gear indicatorAkrapovic full exhaust K&N air intakeHM QuickshifterASV LeversRace GripsDID chainVortex sprockets Vortex rearsets Vortex frame slidersVortex bar endsVortex fairing stay (for race body only)Ohlins rear ShockOhlins steering damper Racetech springs / front fork rebuild EBC front brake rotorsSteel braided brake linesSpeedscreen Amour Bodies full track bodySafety wired oil drain plug, oil filter, and oil capDriven fuel capEngine Ice coolant"

"10,898 miles","$8,780 ",V-STROM 650XT TOURING,  2019 Suzuki Dual Sport,"I traded up in 2019 from a 2012 650xt and have been thrilled with the performance enhancements. I'm the only owner and I have baby'd this bike but of course, had to allow it to see some off road activity. Never dropped and always maintained via my local Suzuki dealer, there is still a year of extended transferable warranty left thru next spring, 2024. 2 inch riser bar mounts give it a comfortable riding position. The sit-n-fly seat cover will accompany the bike to the new owner and I would encourage using it to provide hours of saddle comfort. SW-Motech hard side bags and a Nelson-Rigg soft trunk allow enough gear for a full week trip and the Rigg tank bag is securly positioned for easy reach of the essentials you need at your fingertips. 2 ignition/gas cap/seat lock keys and 2 hard bag keys are included as well as all books and manuals. Michelin rear has 1,000 miles on it and the front Shinko, while having travelled about 2,000 still shows tons of deep tread. The Brake-Away throttle lock is highly functional and actually holds speeds more consistent than any other manual cruise control I've ever  . Upgrading to the Givi Airflow windscreen was one of my best decisions. Truly this aftermarket beauty will allow you the perfect wind shielding position for a rider of any height and any posture style.If you plan to enjoy the TAT or any offroad fun you'll appreciate the massively protective T-Rex skid plate and engine guard duo. Research will show you that the standard poly skid plate that comes as OE equipment is basically worthless. You couldn't drive a tank thru the Rex. I provided a couple of pics into the bags showing the felt lining I added. The tire plug kit is included. Fortunate for me I never had to use it. I'm sure considering making an investment like this will cause questions to surface so I'll always be available via phone, text or email. I have the title in hand so be ready with your financing in place should you choose to purchase my girl. Finally the picture of the WD40 degreaser and chain cleaner brush is to show you that after each ride during the clean up process the chain was properly cleaned and then lubed. Chain tension was checked during every service visit.Did I mention Baha driving lights?"

Never laid down, not a single thing wrong with it! Title in hand, ready to roll. I really do like this bike, if no interest before the ad expires I'll be very content to keep and enjoy this motorcycle; it's an awesome bike. BUT, feeling a sting of buyers remorse with the beautiful weather and envy of seeing other riders enjoying themselves pushed me into an impulse purchase. If someone wants a good discount on a NEW bike, I've got a pretty good offering here. I'll gladly honor the interest of a serious buyer, but otherwise I'll keep this goldilocks gem to myself when the Ad expires, Suzuki made an awesome motorcycle with this one! Why this bike over other Naked sportsbike offerings (based on my own experience with mentioned bikes);Vs. MT-10: Price and better fuel range with larger fuel tank. Power delivery is close to the smoothness of the crossplane, but very peaky with the GSX bike motor; it'll rip at the top end!Vs. MT-09: Much better fuel range still, with more power. Value is excellent for a literbike motor but a bit more expensive than Yamaha's offering.Vs. MT-07: For EXPERIENCED riders, the GSX S1000 has awesome power, there's nowhere to grow out of it except for supersports if that becomes your thing or perhaps a Hayabusa. The MT-07 is an awesome economical choice but you can only do so much with the parralel twin.Vs. CB1000: Value, pretty much. Honda's offering is also an excellent naked sportsbike, just a bit pricier.Vs. Kawasaki line: No personal experience with these, seems like they're using either a parallel twin for the smaller displacement bikes (So probably pretty good albeit limited as the MT-07) and flatplane crank four cylinder motors for their literbike naked Ninja. Comparable, this one would come down to manufacturer and style preference I think?"

But in today's market, these machines have ceded authority to larger literbikes and smaller 600s. Except, that is, for the sterling GSX-R750. A great motorcycle is all about balance, and Suzuki's all-but-invisible 750cc DOHC four has it. It packs 25 percent more displacement than a 600cc supersport motor into a package that's approximately the same size and weight. In fact, despite its displacement bump, at a claimed 419 pounds, the GSX-R750 is only 7 pounds heavier than the GSX-R600. The result is a 750cc sportbike that handles like a 600, accelerates much like a literbike, and doesn't require high revs just to cruise down the road. In engineering, the GSX-R750 and GSX-R600 are akin. Common themes include a twin-spar aluminum frame, feathery titanium valves, rider-selectable power modes, a slipper clutch that helps keep the chassis stable during quick downshifting, and plenty more goodness. If you're in the market for a 600cc supersport, ride the GSX-R750 before inking the deal. It just might convert you. Call or Text us at 415-861-6100 SF Moto is open Monday - Saturday 10 am - 6 pm.

As such, the perennial S40 not only represents the most essential formula for cruisers (one simple cylinder!) but also the most affordable model in Suzuki's Boulevard lineup. Undeniably, the S40 is a budget buy, with its carbureted air-cooled 652cc engine, minimalist running gear including basic suspension, a smallish front single disc and rear drum brakes, and cost-cutting painted surfaces in lieu of chrome. That said, the Boulevard S40 counters with some virtuous features too, including electric starting, a four-valve cylinder head to improve output and fuel efficiency, and fuss-free belt final drive. For learners or smaller riders, the S40 likewise rewards with a low claimed 27.6- inch seat height, a reasonable 381-pound curb weight, and a wide pullback handlebar for good leverage.

927 miles,"$6,798 ",Boulevard S40,  2018 Suzuki Cruiser,"2018 Suzuki Boulevard S40, 2018 Suzuki Boulevard S40 The machine seen here is actually quite a rare bird-a single-cylinder cruiser. As such, the perennial S40 not only represents the most essential formula for cruisers (one simple cylinder!) but also the most affordable model in Suzuki's Boulevard lineup. Undeniably, the S40 is a budget buy, with its carbureted air-cooled 652cc engine, minimalist running gear including basic suspension, a smallish front single disc and rear drum brakes, and cost-cutting painted surfaces in lieu of chrome. That said, the Boulevard S40 counters with some virtuous features too, including electric starting, a four-valve cylinder head to improve output and fuel efficiency, and fuss-free belt final drive. For learners or smaller riders, the S40 likewise rewards with a low claimed 27.6- inch seat height, a reasonable 381-pound curb weight, and a wide pullback handlebar for good leverage.

With its liquid-cooled, 645cc, 90-degree V-twin lifted from the popular, budget- friendly SV650 sport standard, the V-Strom 650-affectionately known as the Wee Strom in deference to its big brother, the V-Strom 1000-is a light, affordable adventure tourer that's been a top-seller in Suzuki's lineup since it debuted for 2004. In our last full test of the V- Strom 650, back in February 2012 after the bike got its first major overhaul, we said it was the ideal do-it-all middleweight-peppy motor, rugged chassis, effortless handling, comfortable seating, 250-mile range, reasonable price. Those are admirable traits, and they still apply to the updated-for-2017 V-Strom 650. But there's something about the bike that's particularly endearing, that allows it to punch far above its weight, yet isn't easy to pin down. You won't find it in the specs or dyno chart. The V-Strom 650 is built to a price and, on Jett Tuning's dyno, the new bike made a modest 68.7 horsepower and 44.2 lb-ft of torque at the rear wheel.

It is hard to believe this is an 11 year old bike as it looks like it just rolled out of the factory yesterday. This is sure to be a future collectible being one of the first years for this generation of GSXR 750 which is the last generation there will ever be. Suzuki has already discontinued the bike in almost every other market in the world and they have said that once they cease production of this bodystyle there will never be another GSXR 750 - the most iconic superbike of all time. This bike is certainly collector quality and would score very highly on any collector assessment for originality and condition. The tank looks brand new inside which is a very important factor when considering an older Suzuki that has obviously spent a lot of its life parked up in the garage as they are notorious for getting rusty if not stored properly. Also the fork seals and factory original chain with blue master link are all like brand new. This bike is truly a time capsule back to the beginning of the bodystyle that has carried the GSXR middleweight marque all the way to present day. The only difference between a 2023 and 2011 is the paint, everything else is identical and with the Japanese jumping on the Go Green bandwagon and pledging to have 100% 0 emission moto fleets within the next 2 - 10 years there will be no more bikes like this in the future so the time to get the GSXR 750 you always dreamed of is NOW!NUMBER OF PREVIOUS OWNERS: 2CURRENT MILEAGE: 987 (May very slightly due to us test riding the bikes, generally less than 200 miles)TITLE STATUS:Clean (No Brands, No liens, Actual Mileage)ORIGINAL OWNERSHIP ITEMS INCLUDED:Spare keyUPGRAGES: NONE - 100% STOCK AND FACTORY ORIGINAL!RECENT SERVICES:Engine Oil and filter (Just performed here at our dealership at time of trade in)New tires replaced due to age (Shown with factory original tires in pictures which we kept in case a collector wants to put into a collection with all factory parts)COSMETIC IMPERFECTIONS: NONE - FLAWLESS!!!MECHANICAL IMPERFECTIONS:NONE - FLAWLESS!!!PRE-OWNED CERTIFICATION LEVEL:GOLD LEVEL CERTIFIED!WARRANTY TYPE:30 Day / 1000 mile FULL wheel to wheel no hassle warrantyPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US FOR A COPY OF OUR INDUSTRY LEADING PRE-OWNED VEHICLE QUALITY ASSURANCE INSPECTION CHECKLIST THAT WAS COMPLETED FOR THIS BIKE!

"9,856 miles","$2,900 ",BOULEVARD S50,  2008 Suzuki Cruiser,"Selling my 2008 Suzuki Boulevard S50. This was my first bike purchased last year from it's second owner - and has been great to learn on, but I'm looking to move to a more naked/sport style bike. Currently has 9856 miles on the clock, though this will go up a bit if the weather gets nicer.This is a great starter bike with a low (27.6 inch) seat height, with steady, predictable power from the 800cc V Twin. With the adjustable levers, low seat height, and crash bars it makes a perfect bike for shorter riders, and has been hassle free and easy to work on. I dropped it twice (gently, in the driveway both times) while learning to ride, so one of the stock levers and the crash bar have some scuffing on them. Overall the bike is in good condition, but it's 16 years old so it isn't showroom new. Looks great from 5 feet, but you can see normal scuffing and the like when you're closer. When it's cold, you do have to use the choke to get it started, but it doesn't have any trouble starting with the choke on. When it's warm, it starts normally.We changed the oil and filter with synthetic Motul 10W-40 and a K&N filter on 9/16/22 @8000 miles. Clutch and brake hydraulics were flushed and replaced 9/26/22 (we didn't record mileage on that one, but around the same as the oil and filter). New battery installed ~10/15/22. The previous owner swapped out the headlight for an LED unit (which is great, provides a lot of light at night) and added aftermarket LED rear turn signals which. really didn't fit the look of the bike. We replaced the rear signals some Kuryakin LED units which match the bike much better. The stock levers were a bit too far from the grips, and were not adjustable, so we swapped them out for purple adjustable levers. It came without a rubber piece on the shift lever, and I haven't gotten around to replacing it - though it's a $3 part you can order online.The stock quick release windshield, stock non-adjustable silver levers + a second pair of purple adjustable levers (got a second set in case I dropped the bike and bent/broke them, as they were hard to find), crash bars and saddlebags are included with the sale (the bags are in good useable shape, but show normal wear).50 cubic inch, four-stroke, liquid cooled, 45 degree V-twin, SOHC, 8-valves, TSCC5 Speed shaft drive transmission~440lbsNo trades. Test rides with a valid motorcycle license/permit, gear, and cash in hand. I live in Rhododendron, Oregon and work remotely, so I can be somewhat flexible for times to check out the bike."

I have serviced it and replaced the front tire. The rear tire looks almost new. It has a low Memphis Fats windshield on it now and a taller screen that is still new in the box. I also have a passenger backrest for it. Otherwise, the bike is totally stock. This is the deluxe version which includes two tone paint and some special embossing on the seat. There is some glue residue from a police association sticker that was on the rear fender and it could use a good polishing all over. I’ve tried to show a true representation of the condition in the photos. If I get time, I may try to shine it up a bit more. Probably not. I have a clean title in my name. I am selling it because I have a few other bikes and a cruiser isn’t really my style. Call or text Steve @ 985-515-0273. I work nights and sleep days so leave a message and I will get back to you.
